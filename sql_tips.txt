-- What is the bar with the highest average price of beer that it sells

-- method 1, calculate max price, find bar with average price that equals max price
select a.bar from 
(select s.bar, avg(s.price) as avg_price from Sells s group by s.bar) a
where a.avg_price = (select max(b.avg_price) as max_price from (select s.bar, avg(s.price) as avg_price from Sells s group by s.bar) b);

(select max(b.avg_price) as max_price from (select s.bar, avg(s.price) as avg_price from Sells s group by s.bar) b) c
where a.avg_price = c.max_price;

-- method 2, left join table against itself, filter for records where there exists a higher price. Highest price will have no matching join, so higher price column will be null
select a.bar from 
(select s.bar, avg(s.price) as avg_price from Sells s group by s.bar) a
left join
(select s.bar, avg(s.price) as avg_price from Sells s group by s.bar) b 
on a.avg_price < b.avg_price

-- method 3, calculate average price for each bar, sort highest to top and get first row
select s.bar from Sells s group by s.bar order by avg(s.price) desc limit 1;
