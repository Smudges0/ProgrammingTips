EditPlus RegExp
=====================

Only supports a limited number of expressions:

Expression Description 
\t Tab character. 
\n New line. 
. Matches any character. 
| Either expression on its left and right side matches the target string. For example, "a|b" matches "a" and "b". 
[] Any of the enclosed characters may match the target character. For example, "[ab]" matches "a" and "b". "[0-9]" matches any digit. 
[^] None of the enclosed characters may match the target character. For example, "[^ab]" matches all character EXCEPT "a" and "b". "[^0-9]" matches any non-digit character. 
* Character to the left of asterisk in the expression should match 0 or more times. For example "be*" matches "b", "be" and "bee". 
+ Character to the left of plus sign in the expression should match 1 or more times. For example "be+" matches "be" and "bee" but not "b". 
? Character to the left of question mark in the expression should match 0 or 1 time. For example "be?" matches "b" and "be" but not "bee". 
^ Expression to the right of ^ matches only when it is at the beginning of line. For example "^A" matches an "A" that is only at the beginning of line. 
$ Expression to the left of $ matches only when it is at the end of line. For example "e$" matches an "e" that is only at the end of line. 
() Affects evaluation order of expression and also used for tagged expression. 
\ Escape character. If you want to use character "\" itself, you should use "\\". 

Tagged Expressions using "()"s are referenced using \1, \2, \3, etc
